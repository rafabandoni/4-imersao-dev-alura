# 4th "Imers√£o Dev" Alura
A free course from Alura with 10 days of daily classes.  
The goal is to dive into javascript, and a little of HTML and CSS, on a mini bootcamp of ten days. The course is made for people with no experience on the language and gives us a first portfolio to work with.  
Each class has it's concepts, a base code and challenges.
